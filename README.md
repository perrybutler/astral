Netcode is coming along well. This also shows a Chromium wrapper being used to launch the game like a native Windows app.

After a long hiatus, I returned to this project to continue where I left off, but I wanted to rewrite the code from the ground up and apply what I learned from the previous prototypes. This time around, I tackled the netcode first, so that a client/server model would be part of the core from the very beginning, without having to overhaul a single player engine into a multiplayer one later.

Once I had a prototype canvas engine working I decided to take things to the next level by doing the Breakouts project and carrying over the inspector/editor ideas from the previous work.

Very early prototype testing out sprite animations, roaming AI and collisions to see what's possible with HTML5 canvas.
