# ASTRAL

A game framework in vanilla JavaScript.

It is a combination of my previous game engine projects and UI designs.

Realtime inspector/editor functionality. This is the framework in its most recent state.

Netcode is coming along well. This also shows a Chromium wrapper being used to launch the game like a native Windows app. This is a custom .NET app which will have its own repo and can optionally be bundled with the finished game for a turn-key product.

After a long hiatus, I returned to this project to continue where I left off, but I wanted to rewrite the code from the ground up and apply what I learned from the previous prototypes. This time around, I tackled the netcode first, so that a client/server model would be part of the core from the very beginning, without having to overhaul a single player engine into a multiplayer one later.

Once I had a prototype canvas engine working I decided to take things to the next level by doing the Breakouts project and carrying over the inspector/editor ideas from the previous work. The last image shows the custom async loader/modules.

Very early prototype testing out sprite animations, roaming AI, shadows/opacity, object sorting, collisions and push physics to see what's possible with HTML5 canvas. The inspector/editor thing was an early incantation.

"Nokia Adventure Game"

It turns out I've been making and scrapping game engines for a while. What can I say? It's fun. This was made many years ago when Nokia phones were the hot ticket.
